# Work experience

## October 2019 – Present day

**Graduate researcher at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/english/">KU Leuven</a>, Belgium (Full time)**

Research in statistics and experimental design in the Biostatistics group at the <a href="https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios">Mechatronics, Biostatistics and Sensors (MeBioS)</a> division of the Biosystems Department.

I created the *<a href="https://github.com/mariobecerra/opdesmixr">opdesmixr</a>* R package for computing Bayesian D-optimal and I-optimal designs for choice models involving mixtures of ingredients and with the assumption of a multinomial logit model. The package uses C++ under the hood to maximize efficiency. Still a work in progress.

I published a paper with my supervisor, <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00006560">Peter Goos</a>, called *Bayesian I-optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures* using our *opdesmixr* package. The paper can be found on [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169743921001635?via%3Dihub) (with paywall) or [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01748) (open access). To reproduce the results in the paper, go to [this Github repository](https://github.com/mariobecerra/i_opt_mixture_choice_models_code).

Talks, seminars and poster:
- Seminar titled *I-optimal versus D-optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures* given at the [DOE-IT Seminars on Design of Experiments](http://www.experimental-design.eu/doe-it/) on June 12th, 2020.
- Talk titled *Bayesian I-optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures* given at the [ENBIS-21 Online Conference](https://conferences.enbis.org/event/11/) on September 14th, 2021. A practice run of the talk can be found [here](https://youtu.be/3uD9yW12Nwg), and the slides can be found <a href="../files/2021-09-14_ENBIS_online_conference_v3.pdf">here</a>.
- Poster titled *Bayesian optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures* presented at the [Design and Analysis of Experiments 2021 Conference Series](https://sites.google.com/view/dae2021/dae-2021) on October 14th, 2021. The poster can be found <a href="../files/i_opt_d_opt_poster_dae_2021-10-14.pdf">here</a>.
- Talk titled *Bayesian D- and I-optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures using a multinomial logit model*, given at the [RSSB-21 Conference](http://rssb2020.uliege.be/program.php) in Liège, Belgium on October 22nd, 2021. A video of it can be found [here](https://youtu.be/GxoVfZRv6Ms), and the slides can be found <a href="../files/2021-10-22_RSSB_conference_Liege_v3.pdf">here</a>.
