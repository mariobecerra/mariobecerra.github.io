# Work experience

## October 2019 – Present day

**Graduate researcher at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/english/">KU Leuven</a>, Belgium (Full time)**

Research in choice modeling, experimental design and statistics in the Biostatistics group at the <a href="https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios">Mechatronics, Biostatistics and Sensors (MeBioS)</a> division of the Biosystems Department.

I created the *<a href="https://github.com/mariobecerra/opdesmixr">opdesmixr</a>* R package for computing Bayesian D-optimal and I-optimal designs for choice models involving mixtures of ingredients and with the assumption of a multinomial logit model. The package uses C++ under the hood to maximize efficiency. Still a work in progress.

Writing:
- *Bayesian I-optimal designs for choice experiments with mixtures*. Paper published in 2021 and co-authored by my supervisor, <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00006560">Peter Goos</a>, using my *opdesmixr* R package. The paper can be found on [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169743921001635?via%3Dihub), and the PDF can be downloaded <a href="../files/becerra_goos_2021_published_elsevier.pdf">here</a>. The accepted manuscript can also be found on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01748). To reproduce the results in the paper, go to [this Github repository](https://github.com/mariobecerra/i_opt_mixture_choice_models_code).
- *Bayesian D- and I-optimal designs for choice experiments involving mixtures and process variables*. To appear in the [Food Quality and Preference journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/food-quality-and-preference). The accepted manuscript can be found on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02604).
- *Willingness-to-pay for football tickets of the Belgian national team*. Working paper about modeling the preferences and willingness-to-pay for match tickets. Done through statistical analysis of a stated-preference choice experiment performed on supporters of the Belgian national team.
