<h2>About me</h2>

	I'm an applied mathematician, data scientist and computer scientist with a bachelor and a master from <u><a href="https://www.itam.mx/en/">ITAM</u></a>. During my bachelor years I took several statistics and data science courses, and my master's program is focused on the fundamentals of computer science. <br>

	My main interests are statistical modeling, predictive analytics, data visualization and machine learning.<br>

	<!--<p>I am an active, open, flexible and versatile worker. I have leadership and teamwork skills, and I can adapt to functions I have no previous experience in. I am, in general, a responsible, honest, disciplined and engaged person who likes things well done.-->
	I enjoy solving problems in an analytical and logical way; and, especially, using data in order to obtain useful information. <br>
